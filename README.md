# Data

The data collected and generated in this work can not be hosted on GitHub for storage reasons. It's currently being uploaded to dedicated repositories and **should soon be made available** in a link in this section.

# How to Run

The project is implemented in python with extensions written in C/C++.
The instructions provided assume a debian based Unix system. Most of the components should still work on different systems.

We first need to install some libraries for the C/C++ modules to be compiled and wrapped to python.

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-python1.49-dev libboost-python1.49.0
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-3 libfftw3-bin libfftw3-dev
```
